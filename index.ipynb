However, in this dataset, we'll notice that although the `Store` and `Dept` columns are both contain integer values, we can intuit that these are meant to be read as categorical data.  We'll want to convert these columns to strings, so that they will be one-hot encoded when we get around to dealing with our categorical columns.  \n",
